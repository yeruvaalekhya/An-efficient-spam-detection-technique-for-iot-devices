This repository presents a robust spam detection system specifically designed for IoT (Internet of Things) devices using advanced machine learning techniques. The project addresses the increasing threat of spam attacks that target resource-constrained IoT devices in smart environments, aiming to enhance security, safeguard user privacy, and maintain device reliability.The rapid proliferation of IoT devices has transformed modern homes and industries but has also exposed these networks to new vulnerabilities including spam, unauthorized access, and malicious control. Conventional spam detection approaches from email or web domains do not transfer well due to differences in device resources and the nature of IoT communications. This project bridges that gap by tailoring spam detection to the unique characteristics of IoT data and traffic.
